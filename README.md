[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/puppetlabs/lumogon)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/puppetlabs/lumogon)

Lumogon provides a way to inspect, analyze and report on your running
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers.

## Trying out Lumogon

### Requirements

| Software      | Version           |
| ------------- |:-----------------:|
| Docker        | 1.13.0 or greater |

### Downloading Lumogon

You'll need [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed and running locally.
This should already be true if you have Docker containers you want to analyze
with Lumogon.

``` shell
docker pull puppet/lumogon
```

### Running Lumogon

Now that you have Lumogon installed, let's run it to find out which
containers you have running and what we can learn about them. The output from a
Lumogon scan will be a [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) listing of all the
containers found and what Lumogon could learn about them.

```
docker run --rm  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock puppet/lumogon scan
```

After a few seconds you should see your JSON data:

Since Lumogon's output is valid JSON, you can slice and dice it with [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/), or pass it
along to any other tool you use that can accept JSON input:

``` shell
docker run --rm  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock puppet/lumogon scan | jq -r  '.containers[] | .container_name + "      " + .capabilities.host.payload.platform + "     " + .capabilities.host.payload.platformversion'

/fixtures_debian-jessie_1      debian     8.7
/fixtures_alpine_1      alpine     3.4.0
/fixtures_centos7_1      centos     7.3.1611
/fixtures_fedora_1      fedora     25
/fixtures_centos6_1      centos     6.8
/fixtures_ubuntu-trusty_1      ubuntu     14.04
/fixtures_debian-wheezy_1      debian     7.11
/fixtures_ubuntu-xenial_1      ubuntu     16.04
```

### Sending reports to the Lumogon service

Lumogon provides an optional web service that can translate your JSON data into
more human friendly reports.

``` shell
docker run --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock puppet/lumogon report
```

The `report` command generates the same data as `scan`, but sends it over HTTPS to
the Lumogon reporting service and returns a URL to view your report.

```
https://reporter.app.lumogon.com/UuokYc0VMgA4oAZYaJRaN6O7xMqakDLsqgHGs0dBmJY=
```

### More ways to use Lumogon

The [examples](examples/README.md) directory provides more thorough examples of
how to use the data provided by Lumogon to test and build your images and containers.

### Lumogon command options

Let's get the usage for the Lumogon client:

```
docker run --rm  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock puppet/lumogon --help
Lumogon is a tool for inspecting, reporting on, and analyzing your container applications.

Usage:
  lumogon [command]

Available Commands:
  help        Help about any command
  report      Scan one or more containers and send the collected information to the Lumogon service
  scan        Scan one or more containers and print the collected information
  version     Show the Lumogon version information

Flags:
  -d, --debug               Print debug logging
      --disable-analytics   Disable sending anonymous data for product improvement
  -k, --keep-harvesters     Keeps harvester containers instead of automatically deleting
```

Feel free to explore those command-line options. Of note:

 - The `--keep-harvesters` flag will preserve temporary containers created on the fly to explore your other containers. You can use `docker logs <containerid>` to see more of what they found while running.
 - You can specify `scan` to collect data on all your running containers, or you can target a specific container by passing `scan <containerid>`.
 - `--debug` will generate verbose debugging output so you can see how Lumogon explores your containers.

## Building the client from source

If you're making changes to Lumogon, or just interested in seeing how it works under the hood, you might want to try building from source. For this you'll need a few more things:

 - Install [Go](https://golang.org/dl/), version 1.8 or later
 - Install `make`
 - Set your `$GOPATH` variable to the path where you want to keep your Go sources -- for example, `${HOME}/go`.
 - Download the Lumogon source code
 - Build the Docker image

The terminal commands to do this are:

```shell
export GOPATH="${HOME}/go"
mkdir -p ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/puppetlabs
cd ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/puppetlabs
git clone https://github.com/puppetlabs/lumogon
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/puppetlabs/lumogon
make all
```

Note that this build process isn't widely tested away from macOS yet but will eventually work everywhere.

## Giving us feedback

We'd love to hear from you. We have a [Slack channel](https://puppetcommunity.slack.com/messages/C5CT7GMKQ) for talking about Lumogon and please do open issues against [the repository](https://github.com/puppetlabs/lumogon/issues).
